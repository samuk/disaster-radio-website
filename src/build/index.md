The disaster.radio hardware is still under development. 

Our first prototypes had a few bugs and we're currently working on a V5 design. 

The source code, custom circuit board layout schematics and enclosure design is all available [on our github repo](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio).

## Order pre assembled  

The software will also run on [pre-assembled dev boards](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/wiki/Devices--&-Hardware)
