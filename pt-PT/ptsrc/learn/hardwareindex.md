The hardware for disaster.radio is as open as possible. The heart of the device is the WiFi-enabled ESP8266 microcontroller and LoRa tranciever.
### ESP8226
A system-on-chip (SOC) microcontroller with built-in WiFi capabilities. This provides WiFi access in the node's immeadiate vicinity, allowing most modern device to connect to the disaster.radio network. ESP8266 chips are very affordable and can be found for as low as $1-$2.

### LoRa
A long-range, low-bandwith radio transceiver, the LoRa SX1276 chip and its chirp-like modulation scheme provide the node-to-node links for the disaster.radio network.

### Power
Powered by a 6V, 3W solar panel and a 3600mAh battery, disaster.radio nodes are capable of functioning in most moderately sunny locations.

### Board
We are in the process of designing a custom PCB prototype, the [schematics and layout](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/tree/master/hardware) are open source and could be re-printed by anyone with the necessary knowledge and means.

### Enclosure
The enclosure for the disaster.radio is designed to be vaccum-formed or 3d printed. The STL can be found on our [github](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/blob/master/enclosure/disaster_radio_enclosure.stl).
